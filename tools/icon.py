"""The application icon, drawn in the standard library.

A PNG writer and a rasteriser in a hundred lines, because the alternative was
adding an imaging library to a tool whose whole claim is that it needs nothing
installed. An icon is a rounded square and a few strokes; that does not justify
a dependency, and a build that pulls one in is a build somebody cannot run.

    python3 tools/icon.py out/          writes icon_16.png … icon_1024.png

Edges are anti-aliased by drawing at four times the size and averaging back
down, which is a page of code rather than a page of coverage mathematics and
looks identical at every size an icon is ever seen at.

The mark is a siphon: a wide mouth narrowing to a spout, and one drop leaving
it. The palette is the window's own, so the icon and the page it opens are
recognisably the same program. This shares its machinery with
`media-preflight`'s icon deliberately — they are siblings, and the family
should look like one.
