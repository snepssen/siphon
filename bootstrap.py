"""Getting the things siphon needs, rather than complaining that they are gone.

siphon ships no binaries. That is the right call — yt-dlp would be stale
within a fortnight and a bundled ffmpeg would carry worse codecs than the one
already on this machine — but it leaves a gap that a tool should close for
somebody rather than hand to them. Being told "install ffmpeg" and being asked
"shall I install ffmpeg?" are a different experience, and only one of them is
a tool doing its job.

So: everything missing is listed, the exact commands are shown, and the
default answer is yes to all of it. Pressing return installs everything.

**Two things it will not do.** It never invokes `sudo` on anybody's behalf —
on a distribution whose package manager needs root, the commands are printed
to run by hand, because a program that silently escalates is a program nobody
should run. And it never installs anything without being asked, except when
explicitly told `--yes`, which is there for scripts and for the launcher.
